GITHUB ACTION to create tag when merge happens into main branch. JENKINS for CICD.
In this CI/CD setup, the Jenkins pipeline automates the deployment process for a React and Node.js project hosted on GitHub.
Triggered by GitHub webhook on a push event, Jenkins builds the React frontend, transfers it to an AWS EC2 instance, and serves it using Nginx.
Simultaneously, the Node.js backend is Dockerized, pushed to Docker Hub, and then pulled and run on the EC2 machine.
This streamlined workflow ensures efficient continuous integration and delivery, allowing for rapid updates and deployments in response to changes in the GitHub repository.
Required Plugins: SSH Agent plugin, node js, Docker pipeline
Create Credentials: dockerhub, github..
